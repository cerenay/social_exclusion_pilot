<h4>Welcome!</h4>
<div class="container1">

        <p>

        We, as a group of researchers, would like to invite you to take part in an experiment which studies decision-making.
            If you agree to take part, the entire experiment will last about 30 minutes.
            </p>

        <li>
           There are no risks for participating in this study beyond those associated with normal computer use.
            All the information collected in this study is for academic purposes only and will be kept strictly anonymous.
            The collected data will be shared in anonymized form in open science repositories.
        </li>
        <li>
        You will receive a $2 show up fee for the experiment.
            The experiment consists of three stages. First, you complete an online task that will take about 10 minutes.
            The payment for this task is up to $2.
            Second, after completing the task, you will have an opportunity to engage in a decision problem in which your payoff from the first stage will be determined.
            Third, in the final stage of the experiment you will again be asked to make a decision and given the chance to earn additional money.
            Your final payment will be the sum of show-up fee, your earnings from the online task and earnings from the last stage of the experiment.
            Minimum total payment is therefore $2, and maximum total payment is $7. Payment to you will be made through Prolific .
        </li>

        Please understand that participation in research is completely voluntary.
        You can decline to answer any questions and are free to stop taking part in the project at any time.
        If you withdraw from the experiment, you will be paid the $2 show up fee but no additional payment.
