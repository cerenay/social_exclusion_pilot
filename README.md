## How to work with the files?
You can download the files and manuanlly upload to the repository again, just like in GDrive and DB. Or you can use Github Desktop and first add the repository to your local computer. 
Afterwards you will see the differences between the online files and your local ones, you if you commit changes they will appear in both. Do not forget to write a summary for all commit so we can keep track.
