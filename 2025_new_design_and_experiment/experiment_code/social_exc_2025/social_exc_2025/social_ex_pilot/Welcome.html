<p>Thank you for participating in this study.</p>

<p>In the first part of the study, you will be shown two paintings — one by <strong>Paul Klee</strong> and one by <strong>Wassily Kandinsky</strong>.</p>

<p>Your task is simple: <strong>choose which painting you prefer</strong>.</p>

<p>This choice will be used to determine which version of a task you will complete later in the study. The task will involve finding numbers in a grid — more details will come after your painting choice.</p>

<p><strong>Please choose honestly based on your preference.</strong> There are no right or wrong answers.</p>
